  - Fix broken test in 5.17.6, where hash ordering is now randomized
    (RT#81388, Karen Etheridge)

0.43      2012-05-21 00:34:04Z
  - Bump dependency on MooseX::Types to 0.35 to resolve issues with recent
    MooseX::Types releases.

0.42      2012-04-23 18:08:19Z
  - Mark failing test due to Eval::Closure/Devel::Declare issues as TODO until
    things are fixed, to at least allow recent versions to install without
    errors.

0.41      2012-03-11 17:05:27Z
  - Add explicit dependency on Eval::Closure, in an effort to get more
    diagnostics from failing cpantesters reports.  No functionality changes.

0.40      2012-03-10 17:03:51Z
  - Loosen a regexp in a test, to handle the new format emitted by Carp 1.25.

0.39      2012-03-10 00:54:18Z
  - The test suite now uses Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception (Karen
    Etheridge).
  - Bump dependency on MooseX::Types::Structured to 0.24, which contains
    more detailed error messages as well as some performance enhancements.

0.38      2012-03-09 23:43:07Z
  - Require B::Hooks::EndOfScope 0.10 and Module::Runtime 0.012, fixing various
    perl 5.8 breakages.

0.37      2011-09-12 09:35:29Z
  - Don't look in the stash for traits or types that contain :: (Jesse Luehrs).

0.36      2010-08-31 21:36:19Z
  - Avoid deprecation warnings from new Moose version by depending on
    MooseX::LazyRequire 0.06 (Jeremy Carman).

0.35      2010-07-19 03:50:08Z
  - Updated to avoid warnings from Moose 1.09 (Dave Rolsky).
  - Switch from Module::Install to Dist::Zilla.

0.34      2010-06-08 17:00:00Z
  - Provides a version of reify that replaces the original version and
    now finally CatalystX::Declare and MooseX::MultiMethods work.

0.33      2010-06-01 16:47:34Z
  - CatalystX::Declare seems to create a method object without a code
    reference at all.

0.32      2010-06-01 16:47:34Z
  - Detect usage of old MXMS::Meta::Method API and retro-compatibilize.

0.31      2010-06-01 16:47:34Z
  - Add support for "does" as a trait declarator
  - Compatibilize MXMS::Meta::Method signature with Class::MOP::Method
    so other traits can apply customizations to the actual body of the
    method.

0.30      2010-02-04 01:41:36Z
  - Make Any instead of Defined the default type constraint.
  - Add tests for coercing optional named parameters (Cory Watson).
    + Make those tests pass by depending on
      MooseX::Types::Structured 0.20.
  - Make sure Text::Balanced doesn't screw up our data.

0.29      2009-10-15 21:27:08Z
  - Fix regression introduced in 0.28.
    Validation for methods without named arguments wasn't strict enough
    anymore. Passing too many arguments hasn't been rejected. Thanks
    Justin Hunter for finding this.

0.28      2009-10-08 23:28:02Z
  - Fix default values for named arguments.

0.27      2009-09-22 12:30:23Z
  - Depend on MooseX::LazyRequire 0.04 to avoid fail on version 0.03, which has
    been broken by recent Moose versions (Closes RT#49903) (Maik Hentsche).

0.26      2009-09-08 18:14:01Z
  - Rebuilt dist to include missing files

0.25      2009-09-07 21:03:03Z
  - Remove scary ALPHA disclaimer from POD
  - Depend on Test::More 0.88 for done_testing

0.24      2009-08-31 17:04:14Z
  - Rename the meta method's clone method to reify. clone already had a special
    meaning for methods in role applications to classes.

0.23      2009-08-27 20:22:40Z
  - Bump Moose dependency to 0.89. This avoids test failures on some older
    Moose versions.

0.22      2009-08-27 13:29:25Z
  - Provide sane closure behaviour for anonymous methods.
  - Add tests for the above (Sebastian Willert).
  - Depend on MooseX::Types 0.19, as 0.18 made us blow up spectacularly.

0.21      2009-08-18 06:45:48Z
  - Add tests for using aliased.pm for type aliases (Steffen Schwigon).
  - Depend on the latest PMS to get type alias resolving.

0.20      2009-08-17 10:11:32Z
  - Make the meta method's parsed_signature public.
  - Use MooseX::LazyRequire's new interface and depend on 0.03.

0.19      2009-08-14 09:23:42Z
  - Move method redefinition warnings to the method application hook so it's
    easy to override.

0.18      2009-08-14 00:24:41Z
  - Depend on Devel::Declare 0.005011. This avoids "->method" and "method =>"
    being misinterpreted sometimes.

0.17      2009-08-13 06:37:31Z
  - Implement method traits (Cory Watson).
  - Properly test list placeholders.
  - Document the right syntax for return value type constraints.
  - Use namespace::autoclean instead of namespace::clean.
  - Let the signature default to (@) if none is given.
  - Don't require the package attribute when a pre-built context is passed
    in.
  - Depend on a recent Parse::Method::Signatures to make sure we will work
    with new PPIs and have the right MooseX::Traits version.
  - Fix doc typo (arcanez).
  - Split out context from self so that we may pass in an arbitrary context
    (nperez).
  - Enable passing a context and also a coderef to use to apply the method
    once constructed (for deferred method modifier application in MXD)
    (nperez).
  - Enable MXMS to work with multiple different declarators and prototype
    injections (nperez).
  - Change from using Devel::Declare::MethodInstaller::Simple to
    ::Context::Simple since strip_attrs was moved down there (nperez).

0.16      2009-05-01 06:03:44Z
  - Bump prereq to Types::Structured to avoid warnings on new Moose versions.
  - Make sure the method keyword is "tight" enough, so
    "@methods = (method { }, method { });" works.
  - Implement non-scalar parameters.
  - Updated documentation.
  - Fix a couple of POD nits (Matt Kraai).

0.15      2009-04-13 02:32:25Z
  - Use MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::ForceCoercion instead of forcing coercion
    manually on validation to make reusing the method type constraints easier.

0.14      2009-04-08 01:45:50Z
  - Depend on MooseX::Types::Structured 0.11. 0.10 had a bug which caused
    validation to always fail.

0.13      2009-03-28 13:04:36Z
  - Fix bug with namespace::clean and MooseX::Types. (Ash Berlin)
  - Rename methods to remove __ANON__ from callstack.
  - Port to using 'from_namespace' from Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003003.
  - Ensure errors from type constraints are reporting from the right place.
  - Now warns if you try to refdefine a method.
  - Return values can now be enforced by using

      method foo ($x) returns (ArrayRef) { }

    This will be documented in the pod once we are happy with the exact
    behaviour. See t/return_value.t for examples for now.
  - Depend upon Parse::Method::Signatures 1.003004 for better error reporting
  - Fix a bug in methods with attributes on perl 5.8.7
  - Fix bug in location of errors with older Mooses
  - Bump minium Moose dep to 0.63

0.12      2009-03-04 02:05:19Z
  - Implement and test scalar placeholder values.
  - Eval default value so reference and string defaults work as expected.
  - Make the testsuite less noisy.

0.11      2009-03-03 02:27:00Z
  - Use MooseX::Types introspection capabilities instead of blindly executing
    functions in other pakages.
  - Stop mentioning the deprecated MX::Method, as requested by its author.
  - Fix and test reporting of compile-time error message (Ash Berlin).
  - Small stylistic whitespace changes in the docs.
  - Test that optional params really are optional (Rhesa Rozendaal).

    interpolations.

0.09      2009-02-23 07:07:47Z
  - Port to MX::Types::Structured.
    + Much more useful error messages, including backtraces.
    + Don't pass undef for parameters now actual value was provided for.
  - Require a Defined value, not a simple Value when no type constraints are
    given.

  - Use Moose meta methods instead of just coderefs.
